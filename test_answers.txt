1) The variable wait is not initialized so it has an indeterminate value. To resolve this case, int wait should just be initialize at zero.

2)In this case, the return is a reference on a value declared inside a function (locale variable), so when the function has ended its execution, the reference doesn't exist anymore. The solution would just be to return a value instead of a reference.

3)In this case, the function printName returns always the BaseClass method because we give it a value as parameter. To correct this issue, we need to give it a reference instead as followed.

void PrintName(MyBaseClass& baseClass)
{
  printf(baseClass.GetName().c_str());
}
